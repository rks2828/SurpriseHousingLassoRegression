# Surprise Housing Assignment - Ridge/Lasso Regression
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information
- The project will perform the data analysis and will create a linear regression Model to predict the SalePrice of the property.
- The Model has to find out the significant variables that can be used to prodict the Sale Price of the Property
- The Linear Regression Model will be optimized using Ridge and Lasso?


## Conclusions
- The Model is able to predict the SalePrice
- Using Lasso, We found the significant variables - Conditions_PosN and PosN, Exteriors_Wd Sdng and ImStucc	,RoofMatl_WdShngl, Neighborhood_NridgHt, Neighborhood_NoRidge, GrLivArea, Exteriors_Stucco and Stucco, LotShape_IR3	 	


## Technologies Used
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- sklearn, statsmodel
- python-3.12
